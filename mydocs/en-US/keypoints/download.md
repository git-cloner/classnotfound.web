#  Download the jar package and parse it

Download the jars one by one according to the path of the jar package, parse the classname inside, and delete the jars after parsing. When downloading jars, you do not need to download all the jars, just download the latest version, so that the latest jar can be found by the class name. If you need the download link of the previous version, you can directly extract the version number from the database according to the path name of the jar and then look for it fuzzy.
