More than 7 million jars and 40 million classes are stored, including all the jar information in maven central.

In order to improve the speed of inclusion and increase the frequency of inclusion, only the latest version of the class information in the same type of jar package is retained in the database, so that on the one hand, the retrieval speed is fast, and on the other hand, the jar and class can also be included.
