# Updating

Synchronize data from maven central at regular intervals, and keep the jar and class information continuously updated.

Since a large amount of data has been synchronized to the mysql database, the subsequent incremental update is faster, and it can now be updated once a week, which ensures that users will search for the latest information of the jar package, rather than the information of a few years ago.
